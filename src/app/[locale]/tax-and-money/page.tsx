            <p>
              Most residents can open a UK current account with a bank or a
              digital provider. Requirements vary, but you typically need
              identity and address verification. If you are new to the UK and do
              not yet have bills or a tenancy in your name, some providers allow
              alternative proofs. A{" "}
              <A href={links.basicBankAccounts}>basic bank account</A> may be
              available if you are eligible and do not qualify for a standard
              account.
            </p>
            <h3>General steps</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Choose a regulated firm (bank, building society or e-money
                institution). Check the{" "}
                <A href={links.fcaRegister}>FCA Register</A>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Prepare your ID and proof of address (passport/ID card; utility
                bill, tenancy, council letter). See general guidance on{" "}
                <A href={links.govProofOfAddress}>proof-of-address checks</A>.
              </li>
              <li>Apply (in-branch or app) and complete verification.</li>
              <li>
                Understand protection: eligible deposits are covered up to the{" "}
                <A href={links.fscs}>FSCS</A> limit per person per firm. E-money
                accounts are safeguarded but not covered by FSCS.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p className="!mt-2">
              <strong>Tip:</strong> Turn on security (biometrics, strong
              authentication, card controls) and keep your address and contact
